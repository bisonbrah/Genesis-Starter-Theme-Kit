# Genesis Starter Theme - Dev Kit
>Finally, a starter theme for the Genesis Framework that doesn't complicate your life.

A development kit for WordPress themes which includes starter SCSS files and a Gulp task file which automates:

1. JS compression
2. SCSS compiling and compression
3. generation of a POT file for translation
4. Automatic zipping of the theme without including the development files.

**SUGGESTED**: This dev kit was originally built for my own Starter theme on the Genesis Framework. <a href="https://calvinkoepke.com/genesis-starter-theme/">Download the full Starter theme for free &rarr;</a>

### Reasons to Use Starter

- It's lightweight (170kb development / kb production ).
- It's mobile-first (read why <a href="https://calvinkoepke.com/mobile-first">this is a good thing</a>).
- It comes pre-packaged with default settings and templates that are common in Genesis child theme development.
- It removes unnecessary (and discouraged) templates from the parent Genesis theme (say goodbye to the blog template).
- It has almost **zero** styling, reducing visual influence on your projects.
- It comes with a ready-to-use, modified version of <a href="http://robincornett.com/genesis-responsive-menu/">Robin Cornett's responsive menu</a>.

### Optional Perks

- Starter comes with SCSS files, but are not required to start out of the gate â€” just delete if that's not your thing.
- It also comes with a landing page template, with ideas for more to be added in future releases.

## Installation
- Clone the repo to your desktop, somewhere **other** than in your theme root (you don't want updates to override your theme edits!)
- Copy the files in the cloned repo to your theme root.
- Move `/scss/` to the `/assets/` directory.
- In terminal, do the following command:
`npm install --save-dev`
- You're good to go!

## What Gulp Does
- The Gulp task file will watch dev files under `/assets/` in the SCSS/JS directories and rebuild files on the fly.
- **Note:** To separate dev from prod files, the tasker will output minified files to a `/build/` folder at the theme root.
- File naming will stay the same with `.min.ext` appended to the file name.
